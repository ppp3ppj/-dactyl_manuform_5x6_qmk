# Dactyl Keyboard Configurations - QMK Firmware
This repository contains my QMK firmware configurations for two custom ergonomic keyboards:

-   **Dactyl Manuform 5x6**
-   **Dactyl CC**

### Overview

These configurations are tailored to provide an ergonomic and efficient typing experience using the [QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard)](https://qmk.fm/) firmware. Both keyboards use a split, concave column-staggered layout designed to reduce strain and increase comfort during prolonged use.

### Keyboard Layouts
**Dactyl Manuform 5x6**:

-   5x6 column-staggered layout, with 5 rows and 6 columns per hand.
-   Commonly used for text editing, programming, and general computing tasks.

**Dactyl CC**:

-   Similar ergonomic design with slight adjustments for custom switch placements.
-   Includes optimized layer functionality for navigation, numbers, and symbols.
